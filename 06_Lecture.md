# Types of Communication

### 🔁 **Synchronous Communication (Strong Coupling)**

- Real-time request-response pattern where the client waits for a server response.
- Tight integration and immediate feedback.
- Examples:

  - **HTTP (REST/GraphQL)** – Request-response model over TCP.
  - **WebSocket** _(debatably synchronous)_ – Real-time, persistent connection but async in message handling.

### 🕒 **Asynchronous Communication (Loose Coupling)**

- Client and server communicate independently; no waiting/blocking for responses.
- More scalable and fault-tolerant.
- Examples:

  - **Message Queues** – Kafka, RabbitMQ.
  - **Pub/Sub Systems** – Redis Pub/Sub, Google Pub/Sub.
  - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** – One-way real-time updates from server to browser.
  - **WebSocket** _(debatably asynchronous)_ – Real-time bidirectional updates.

## 📌 **WebSocket**

> **A protocol** enabling real-time, low-latency, full-duplex communication over a single persistent connection.

### 🔍 **Key Features:**

1. **Protocol**, not a library (RFC 6455).
2. Enables **full-duplex** (two-way) communication between client and server.
3. Establishes a **persistent connection** after a one-time HTTP handshake.
4. Requires **manual handling** of:

   - Reconnection logic
   - Heartbeats (ping/pong)
   - Custom event/message formats

5. **Fast and lightweight**, ideal for performance-sensitive applications.
6. Needs **browser or client environment** to support WebSocket.
7. Does **not support rooms/namespaces** natively — you build it yourself.
8. Great when you want **fine-grained control** and performance.

### ✅ **Use Cases:**

- Real-time chat applications
- Online multiplayer games
- Live dashboards (e.g., stock tickers, analytics)
- Collaborative tools (whiteboards, editors)
- IoT & sensor data streaming

## ❌ **Limitations of HTTP/REST (Why WebSocket?):**

| Limitation        | Explanation                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Stateless         | Each request is independent; no persistent connection |
| Request-Only Flow | Server can't push data unless polled                  |
| Polling Overhead  | Frequent polling increases latency and server load    |
| Latency           | Each request has TCP and HTTP handshake overhead      |

## ⚙️ **WebSocket in Node.js with `ws`**

### 🔧 Setup:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript
npx tsc --init
# Edit tsconfig.json:
# "rootDir": "./src",
# "outDir": "./dist"

npm install ws @types/ws
```

### 🔌 Basic Example:

```ts
import express from "express";
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";

const app = express();
const httpServer = app.listen(8080, () => console.log("Server running"));

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: httpServer });

wss.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("Client connected");
  socket.send("Hello from server!");

  // Listen for messages from the client
  socket.on("message", (message) => {
    console.log("Received:", message.toString());
    socket.send("Hi there, got your message!");
  });
});
```

## 📌 **Socket.IO**

> A **JavaScript library** that abstracts WebSocket and adds rich real-time capabilities like rooms, events, and automatic fallbacks.

### 🔍 **Key Features:**

1. Built **on top of WebSocket** with fallback mechanisms (long polling, etc.).
2. Uses **event-based communication** via `.emit()` and `.on()`.
3. Comes with **auto-handling** of:

   - Reconnects
   - Heartbeats
   - Connection fallback (XHR/long polling)

4. Supports **namespaces and rooms** out of the box.
5. **Heavier than raw WebSocket** due to added features.
6. Deep **Node.js ecosystem integration**.
7. **Cross-platform support** is less stable (e.g., mobile, Rust clients need native wrappers).
8. Best suited for rapid development of real-time features.

### ✅ **Use Cases:**

- Chat apps with group/room-based communication
- Multiplayer games
- Notifications and alerts
- Collaborative platforms (e.g., Google Docs-like tools)

| You want full control, performance      | ✅ Use WebSocket        |
| You want built-in features, quick setup | ✅ Use Socket.IO        |
| You need mobile/Rust/Go support         | ⚠️ Prefer raw WebSocket |
| You need rooms, namespaces, fallback    | ✅ Use Socket.IO        |
