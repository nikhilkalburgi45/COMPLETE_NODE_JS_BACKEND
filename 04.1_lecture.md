# A simple mongodb project

---

### Why connect to a database?

Your app needs a database to **store, update, retrieve, and delete** data persistently.

---

### Example Code to Connect:

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const connectDb = () => {
  mongoose
    .connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/practice", {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log("Database connected successfully");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error("Database connection error:", err);
    });
};

// Call the function to connect
connectDb();
```

---

### Explanation:

- `mongoose.connect()` takes the MongoDB URI — here connecting to local MongoDB with database named `practice`.
- The options `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` are recommended for stable connection.
- On successful connection, it logs a success message.
- If it fails, it logs the error for debugging.

---

### How to test this?

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally (`mongod` service).
2. Run your Node.js app.
3. You should see `"Database connected successfully"` if connected.

---

### Real-World Context

In a real app, this connection code is usually done once at server start-up, so your entire app can use the database connection throughout.

# Creating a Mongoose Schema and Model

---

### What is a Schema?

- A **Schema** in Mongoose defines the **structure** of the documents in a MongoDB collection.
- It specifies the **fields**, their **data types**, and any **validation rules** or **default values**.

---

### What is a Model?

- A **Model** is a **constructor compiled from the schema**.
- It provides an interface to interact with the database — for example, to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** documents.

---

### Example: Product Schema and Model

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Define the schema
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: [true, "Name is mandatory"],
    },
    price: {
      type: Number,
      required: [true, "Price is mandatory"],
      min: [0, "Price can't be negative"],
    },
    quantity: {
      type: Number,
      required: [true, "Quantity is mandatory"],
      min: [0, "Quantity can't be negative"],
    },
    category: {
      type: String,
      enum: ["clothing", "electronics", "household"],
      required: [true, "Category is mandatory"],
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true } // adds createdAt and updatedAt fields automatically
);

// Create the model
const Product = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);

module.exports = Product;
```

---

### Explanation:

- **Fields:**

  - `name`: String, required
  - `price`: Number, required, must be >= 0
  - `quantity`: Number, required, must be >= 0
  - `category`: String, must be one of the listed categories

- `timestamps: true` adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields automatically.
- `Product` model will use the `products` collection in MongoDB (Mongoose auto-pluralizes model name).

---

### Real-World Example

Suppose you are building an e-commerce app — this schema defines how a product will be stored in your database, enforcing data rules to keep your data consistent.

---

# 1. Creating API Endpoint to **Create (POST)** Product Data

---

### Goal:

- Receive product data from client via POST request
- Validate and save it in MongoDB using Mongoose model
- Send back confirmation or error response

---

### Setup:

Make sure you have Express app running and connected to MongoDB.
Add this before the route:

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON body from requests
```

---

### Code for POST `/products` Endpoint:

```js
const Product = require("./models/Product"); // import your model

app.post("/products", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Incoming Data:", req.body);

  // Create new product instance from request body
  const newProduct = new Product(req.body);

  // Save to DB
  newProduct
    .save()
    .then((savedProduct) => {
      res
        .status(201)
        .send({ data: savedProduct, message: "Product Created Successfully" });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(400)
        .send({ message: "Error creating product", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `req.body` contains the incoming product data in JSON format (parsed by `express.json()` middleware).
- `new Product(req.body)` creates a new document instance.
- `.save()` writes it to MongoDB.
- On success, sends **201 Created** status and the saved product data.
- On error (e.g., validation fails), sends **400 Bad Request** with error message.

---

### Real-World Use Case

- When a seller adds a new product to your e-commerce platform, the frontend sends product details as JSON to this API.
- The API stores the product safely in the database, enforcing all validation rules.

---

# 2. Fetching All Product Data (GET `/products`)

---

### Goal:

- Retrieve **all** products from the database.
- Send the list as a JSON response to the client.

---

### Code for GET `/products` Endpoint:

```js
app.get("/products", (req, res) => {
  Product.find()
    .then((products) => {
      res.status(200).send(products);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(500)
        .send({ message: "Error fetching products", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `Product.find()` fetches **all** documents from the `products` collection.
- On success, it sends status **200 OK** with the array of products.
- On error, it sends status **500 Internal Server Error** with a message.

---

### Real-World Use Case

- When a user visits the products page on your e-commerce site, the frontend calls this API to get the list of all products to display.

---

Want me to explain next: **Fetching single product by ID (GET `/products/:id`)**?

Awesome! Let’s go step-by-step.

---

# 3. Fetching a Single Product by ID (GET `/products/:id`)

---

### Goal:

- Get the details of a **specific product** by its unique ID.
- Send that product data as a JSON response.

---

### Code for GET `/products/:id` Endpoint:

```js
app.get("/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.id;

  Product.findById(productId)
    .then((product) => {
      if (!product) {
        return res.status(404).send({ message: "Product not found" });
      }
      res.status(200).send(product);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(500)
        .send({ message: "Error fetching product", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `req.params.id` captures the product ID from the URL (e.g., `/products/123` → `123`).
- `Product.findById(productId)` searches the database for the product with that ID.
- If no product is found (`null`), respond with **404 Not Found**.
- Otherwise, send the product data with **200 OK**.
- If an error occurs (e.g., invalid ID format), respond with **500 Internal Server Error**.

---

### Real-World Use Case

- When a user clicks on a product in your online store, the frontend calls this API to get **detailed info** about that specific product to display on the product details page.

---

Ready for the next?
**Deleting a product by ID (DELETE `/products/:id`)**?

Great! Let’s dive into:

---

# 4. Deleting a Product by ID (DELETE `/products/:id`)

---

### Goal:

- Delete a product from the database by its unique ID.
- Respond with a success or failure message.

---

### Code for DELETE `/products/:id` Endpoint:

```js
app.delete("/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.id;

  Product.findByIdAndDelete(productId)
    .then((deletedProduct) => {
      if (!deletedProduct) {
        return res.status(404).send({ message: "Product not found" });
      }
      res
        .status(200)
        .send({ message: "Product deleted successfully", deletedProduct });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(500)
        .send({ message: "Error deleting product", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `req.params.id` gets the product ID from the URL.
- `Product.findByIdAndDelete(productId)` tries to find the product and delete it.
- If no product is found, it sends a **404 Not Found** response.
- If deleted successfully, sends **200 OK** with a success message and optionally the deleted product data.
- Errors are handled with a **500 Internal Server Error** response.

---

### Real-World Use Case

- An admin or user wants to delete a product from their inventory or catalog.
- The frontend calls this endpoint when the user clicks a "Delete" button on the product page.

---

# 5. Updating a Product by ID (PUT `/products/:id`)

---

### Goal:

- Update an existing product’s details by its unique ID.
- Use data sent in the request body.
- Respond with success or error messages.

---

### Code for PUT `/products/:id` Endpoint:

```js
app.put("/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.id;
  const updatedData = req.body;

  Product.findByIdAndUpdate(productId, updatedData, {
    new: true,
    runValidators: true,
  })
    .then((updatedProduct) => {
      if (!updatedProduct) {
        return res.status(404).send({ message: "Product not found" });
      }
      res
        .status(200)
        .send({ message: "Product updated successfully", updatedProduct });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(400)
        .send({ message: "Error updating product", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `req.params.id` gets the product ID from the URL.
- `req.body` contains the updated fields to apply.
- `Product.findByIdAndUpdate()`:

  - Finds the product by ID.
  - Updates it with `updatedData`.
  - Options:

    - `{ new: true }` returns the updated document.
    - `{ runValidators: true }` runs schema validators on update.

- If product not found, returns **404 Not Found**.
- On success, returns **200 OK** with the updated product.
- On validation or other errors, returns **400 Bad Request** with error details.

---

### Real-World Use Case:

- A seller wants to update price, quantity, or category of a product in their catalog.
- The frontend provides a form with updated fields, sends them here via PUT request.

---

Shall we move on to **fetching all products (GET `/products`)** or is there any specific part you'd like to focus on?
Great! Let’s move on to the next:

---

# 6. Fetching All Products (GET `/products`)

---

### Goal:

- Retrieve all product records stored in the database.
- Send the data back as JSON.

---

### Code for GET `/products` Endpoint:

```js
app.get("/products", (req, res) => {
  Product.find()
    .then((products) => {
      res.status(200).json(products);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(500)
        .json({ message: "Error fetching products", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- `Product.find()` fetches all documents in the `products` collection.
- On success:

  - Sends HTTP status 200 (OK).
  - Sends the array of products as JSON.

- On error:

  - Logs error to console.
  - Sends HTTP status 500 (Internal Server Error) with error message.

---

### Real-World Use Case:

- An online store displays all available products on the homepage.
- This API call helps frontend get the full product list to show to customers.

---

# 7. Fetching a Single Product by ID (GET `/products/:id`)

---

### Goal:

- Retrieve a specific product by its unique ID.
- Return the product details if found.

---

### Code for GET `/products/:id` Endpoint:

```js
app.get("/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.id;

  Product.findById(productId)
    .then((product) => {
      if (!product) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: "Product not found" });
      }
      res.status(200).json(product);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      res
        .status(500)
        .json({ message: "Error fetching product", error: err.message });
    });
});
```

---

### Explanation:

- Extract `id` from URL params via `req.params.id`.
- Use `Product.findById(id)` to get the document matching that ID.
- If product doesn’t exist, respond with 404 (Not Found).
- If found, respond with 200 (OK) and product data.
- On error (e.g., invalid ID format), respond with 500 and error details.

---

### Real-World Use Case:

- When a user clicks on a specific product to view its details page, the frontend calls this API to load that product’s info.

---

Shall we move on to **deleting a product** next?
